Domination.java is a program that was made to randomly generate a certain number of graphs
(also random), and find the size of the smallest dominating set and also the weight
of the smallest-weight roman dominating set.

The file named KlosterPaper is an essay written by me. It describes a problem in graph theory
based on edge and vertex coloring, known as rainbow-coloring. The problem is extensive and
complex, but in the paper I do my best to understand it and describe the implications of the 
problem.
