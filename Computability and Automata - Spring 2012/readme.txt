Project 1 is the famous firefighters problem. It codes an environment for the evaluation of the problem.
A fire is set in a random location of the grid, and the firefighters must minimize damages.

Project 2 is the famous cops n robbers problem. The environment is coded to have the robber stay
free as long as possible.

Both are coded in C, and have extensive documentation files included.
