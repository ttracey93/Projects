This project was the first project of my compilers class.

This program takes in a file, a generates tokens for the use of a parser. 

I've included a sample input file for you to use.

To easily run this program, copy all files to a unix directory
and run the commands:
>make
>p1 testfile.txt

//p1 is a korn shell script
