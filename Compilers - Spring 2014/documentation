Just finished around 10 pm on 1/23/14.

I wrote this program in java. The first thing I did was define an 
enumeration to declare the types of tokens I could have (Keyword, 
SpecialSymbol, ID, NUM, Float, letter, digit, Line, Error). I then created 
the Token object, which has a Type and a string holding its contents.

My main method reads in the file line by line using a scanner and sends 
each line to a method called generateTokensFromLine(). That method breaks 
up the line by whitespace and then analyzes each token separately. I start 
out by checking the easy cases (if the token is exactly a keyword, or 
exactly a delimiter, etc.). If it is none of the easy cases, I go through 
the token line by line. 

The method that goes through everything line by line is pretty simple. If 
the character it is currently at is a delimiter, it checks if the current 
character plus the next character also makes a compound delimiter. If it 
does it adds them together, makes a token objects and then goes past the 
second character. If not, it adds that character. If its not a delim and 
a temp string is empty, it adds the character to the temp string. It keeps 
adding chars to the temp string until it reaches a delimiter, and then 
does it all over again, sending the temp string to a final method and 
clearing the temp string. The last method, analyze, checks all the easy 
cases again (since all delimters have been removed) and if the token does 
not match any of them it spawns an error. 

Thank you, and enjoy grading!
