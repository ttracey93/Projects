The AI project that my team worked on was built to assess the choices made by a player and
decide what they would do next. You can read more about the project in the proposal we made,
and there is a powerpoint included that we used to present our idea to the class. The last document
to mention is the AiReport file. This report includes our finding on the project, and how we feel the experiment
went overall. The report was written by me, with some help from another group member. The code was written mostly
by myself.
