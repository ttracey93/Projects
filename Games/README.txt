Games :

Ardent Dawn is a game that I designed from the ground up in XNA in less than 48 hours. I went
to the Global Game Jam in January 2014 in winter park florida, where I was randomly assigned a team
(excluding my friend Max King-Wilson, who accompanied me there from jacksonville). We had 48 hours to
code the game. I built the engine from the ground up, coding the objects and how they interacted and
their limitations, as well as the sound, graphics, and animations. My friend coded the enemy AI and
collision, and a separate member made the art for the game.

Pong is a simple 2D pong clone that I made in less than an hour with XNA. The art assets and programming
are original and hand-made.
