This project was created by Tyler Tracey (n00767255).
I finished it on the night of the 22nd. (1/22/2013)

The programs purpose is to create a hashing table. There are three classes 
included in the .java file. The first class is the Item class. This class 
just allows me to create an items that has both a string (its key) and an 
int (its address). 

The second class is the HashTable class. This class has some major 
things. First of all it holds the Item array that acts as my actual hash 
table. My original idea was to just have two arrays, one that held the 
string(key) for each item and one that held the address of each item, but 
instead I chose to make the Item class to hold both and just make an array 
of those objects. This class also has all of the methods necessary for a 
hashtable: insert(), find(), hash(), delete(), etc.

The last class in the file I have titled HashTableMain. This is basically 
the actual application. All it has is a main method. The main method opens 
the file that the user of the program has specified and starts reading in 
Items. For each Item read it makes an Item and deals with it according to 
the project specifications. If the item does not exist in the array, it 
hashes it and stores it at the best possible spot. If the items does exist 
the program reports its location as well as the address accompanying it.

Enjoy grading!
